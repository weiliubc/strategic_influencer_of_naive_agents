# Exploration of Comparison Theorem for Riccati Equations

This folder contains notebooks regarding "A comparison theorem for matrix Riccati difference equations" by Wimmer and Pavon (1992).

## December 2021

### [Initial Check](https://github.com/jbrightuniverse/strategic_influencer_of_naive_agents/blob/main/comparison_theorem/initial_check.html)
This notebook provides some initial checks of Theorem 1.1 on the strategic agent model; these indicated that the theorem may not help with comparative statics for epsilon-changes in the matrices. There was a typo in checking the B matrix which was fixed in a subsequent notebook.

### [Further Check](https://github.com/jbrightuniverse/strategic_influencer_of_naive_agents/blob/main/comparison_theorem/further_check.html)
This notebook checks the B matrix as mentioned above, but no working results were found either.

### [Schur Complement](https://github.com/jbrightuniverse/strategic_influencer_of_naive_agents/blob/main/comparison_theorem/schur_complement_check.html)
This notebook checks the application of the Schur complement test to the model, but there was an apparent contradiction that prevents the test from being used. The notebook has a text typo in that `the matrix in block 2 is not positive semidefinite` which does not impact any results.
