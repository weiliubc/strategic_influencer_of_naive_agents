# Dynamic Targeting

This folder contains notebooks relating to the dynamic targeting model in which a different agent can be targeted in each period.

### [Dynamic Example](https://github.com/jbrightuniverse/strategic_influencer_of_naive_agents/blob/main/dynamic_targeting/dynamic_examples.html)
This notebook provides an initial exploration of the dynamic targeting model. The optimal choices each have a similar form, which is provided in the notebook.

### [Gain in the Dynamic Example](https://github.com/jbrightuniverse/strategic_influencer_of_naive_agents/blob/main/dynamic_targeting/gain_in_dynamic.html)
This notebook explores the source of the payoff increase in the dynamic targeting model versus the original targeting model. This was found to be associated with early-period message magnitudes but there was no clear cause.

### [Static Splitting Model](https://github.com/jbrightuniverse/strategic_influencer_of_naive_agents/blob/main/dynamic_targeting/splitting_model.html)
This notebook explores a model where the strategic agent's influence is split across the two agents being targeted. This model outperforms the dynamic case except where the optimal split is no split (which is the original targeting model, which we know the dynamic case outperforms).
