### [Equation Test](https://github.com/jbrightuniverse/strategic_influencer_of_naive_agents/blob/main/unified_model/equation_test.ipynb)
This notebook does a quick check of the convergence rates for the naive agent opinions and finds that they are increasing in the corresponding eigenvalue of A.

### [Equation Test: Ratio](https://github.com/jbrightuniverse/strategic_influencer_of_naive_agents/blob/main/unified_model/equation_test_ratio.ipynb)
This notebook tries the above procedure with the expression $K_j^* / \lambda_j$ instead. It turns out that this expression is not monotone in $\lambda_j$.

### [Equation Test: Ratio Reciprocal](https://github.com/jbrightuniverse/strategic_influencer_of_naive_agents/blob/main/unified_model/equation_test_ratio_2.ipynb)
This notebook is the above notebook but with analysis on $\lambda_j / K_j^*$, the reciprocal of the above expression. The same result is observed as the previous notebook.
