TODO: move some notebooks from the baseline unified model into this folder

## October 2022

### [Different Agendas: K^* printouts](https://github.com/weiliubc/strategic_influencer_of_naive_agents/blob/main/unified_multiple_strategic/mus_different_agenda_K.ipynb)
This notebook provides code for the infinite-horizon $K^*$ and some printouts under the symmetric network case.

## November 2022

### [Full General Model](https://github.com/weiliubc/strategic_influencer_of_naive_agents/blob/main/unified_multiple_strategic/mus_old_revised.ipynb)
This notebook upgrades the old multiple strategic agents general code to work with the unified model. Results are preliminary and outlined inside. The results from the symmetric cases continue to hold with this model.

### [Asymmetric Network Analysis](https://github.com/weiliubc/strategic_influencer_of_naive_agents/blob/main/unified_multiple_strategic/mus_asymmetric_analysis.ipynb)
This notebook provides some printouts comparing steady-state matrices and limit opinions of symmetric and asymmetric networks under otherwise identical setups. The limit opinions in both cases, given two strategic agents with one agenda set to zero, appears to be the average of the two agendas. The element sum of each $k^*$ appears to be linear in the two agendas with equal but opposite coefficients and zero-intercepts.
