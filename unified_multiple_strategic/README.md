## October 2022

### [Different Agendas: K^* printouts](https://github.com/weiliubc/strategic_influencer_of_naive_agents/blob/main/unified_multiple_strategic/mus_different_agenda_K.ipynb)
This notebook provides code for the infinite-horizon $K^*$ and some printouts under the symmetric network case.

### [Full General Model](https://github.com/weiliubc/strategic_influencer_of_naive_agents/blob/main/unified_multiple_strategic/mus_old_revised.ipynb)
This notebook upgrades the old multiple strategic agents general code to work with the unified model. Results are preliminary and outlined inside. The results from the symmetric cases continue to hold with this model.
