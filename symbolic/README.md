# Symbolic Analysis

This folder contains experiments with symbolic solvers used to evaluate algebraic expressions directly instead of through numerical means.

## August 2021

### [Demo](https://github.com/jbrightuniverse/strategic_influencer_of_naive_agents/blob/main/symbolic/demo.pdf)
This notebook is a brief demo of the SymPy symbolic solver in Python and how it can be used for analysis of the algebraic riccati equations.

### [First-Order Conditions](https://github.com/jbrightuniverse/strategic_influencer_of_naive_agents/blob/main/symbolic/first_order_conditions.pdf)
This notebook is similar to the previous but focuses on one first-order condition example using the recursive equations.

### [Analytical Multi-Message Verification](https://github.com/jbrightuniverse/strategic_influencer_of_naive_agents/blob/main/multiple_strategic_agents/analytical_multi_message_verification.pdf)
This notebook, hosted in the multiple strategic agents folder, provides another symbolic example in which the model for a single strategic agent with two message channels is solved.
