# Symbolic Analysis

This folder contains experiments with symbolic solvers used to evaluate algebraic expressions directly instead of through numerical means.

### [Demo](https://github.com/weiliubc/strategic_influencer_of_naive_agents/blob/main/symbolic/demo.pdf)
This notebook is a brief demo of the SymPy symbolic solver in Python and how it can be used for analysis of the algebraic riccati equations.

### [First-Order Conditions](https://github.com/weiliubc/strategic_influencer_of_naive_agents/blob/main/symbolic/first_order_conditions.pdf)
This notebook is similar to the previous but focuses on one first-order condition example using the recursive equations.

### [Analytical Multi-Message Verification](https://github.com/weiliubc/strategic_influencer_of_naive_agents/blob/main/multiple_strategic_agents/analytical_multi_message_verification.pdf)
This notebook, hosted in the multiple strategic agents folder, provides another symbolic example of the above using a particular set of initial parameters. Note that there is a sign typo that was fixed in a subsequent version.

### [Analytical Multi-Message Verification (fixed)](https://github.com/weiliubc/strategic_influencer_of_naive_agents/blob/main/multiple_strategic_agents/analytical_multi_message_verification_fixed.pdf)
This notebook, hosted in the multiple strategic agents folder, fixes a sign typo in the first-order conditions at the beginning of the above notebook.

### [Analytical Dual Message Single Agent Case](https://github.com/weiliubc/strategic_influencer_of_naive_agents/blob/main/multiple_strategic_agents/analytical_dual_message_single_agent.pdf)
This notebook, hosted in the multiple strategic agents folder, does the above exercise with the two message one strategic agent model.

### Symbolic Targeting Solution: [first agent](https://github.com/weiliubc/strategic_influencer_of_naive_agents/blob/main/symbolic/symbolic_target_first.pdf) and [second agent](https://github.com/weiliubc/strategic_influencer_of_naive_agents/blob/main/symbolic/symbolic_target_second.pdf)
These notebooks attempt to symbolically solve scenarios where the strategic agent targets a particular naive agent. The resulting expressions were not easy to work with due to their complexity.

### [Symbolic Targeting and Cost Analysis](https://github.com/weiliubc/strategic_influencer_of_naive_agents/blob/main/symbolic/symbolic_targeting_and_cost_analysis.pdf)
This notebook improves some of the symbolic equations from above.
