### [Basic Example](https://github.com/jbrightuniverse/strategic_influencer_of_naive_agents/blob/main/full_targeting/basic_example.pdf)
This notebook was a quick check of the targeting model with stubborn and easily-influenced naive agents. Targeting the stubborn agent was found to be more optimal. This notebook also set the choice of reweighting the strategic agent's influence between the two naive agents to be a simple weighted average of the existing A matrix row and the influence weight of the strategic agent.
